# example-workflow

This workflow is a broken down version of https://github.com/EBI-Metagenomics/pipeline-v5/blob/master/workflows/subworkflows/classify-otu-visualise.cwl

The contained workflow example_workflow.cwl can be executed, for the rewritten workflow wrapped_workflow_example_workflow.cwl, the absolute paths need to be changed, or
the rewriter can be used to properly rewrite the workflow on your system: [CWL Rewriter](https://github.com/emulation-as-a-service/cwl-rewriter)
